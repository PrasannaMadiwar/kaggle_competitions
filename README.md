# Kaggle Competition - First Submission Repository

## Project Title: [Insert Official Competition Name]
*Example: Spaceship Titanic - Classification Challenge*

This repository contains the complete solution notebook for my first Kaggle competition. It reflects my learning process, experimentation, and optimization techniques aimed at achieving a top position on the leaderboard.

## Competition Overview

- **Competition Name**: [Insert Full Competition Name]
- **Platform**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Objective**: [Brief description, e.g., "Predict whether a passenger was transported to another dimension based on various features."]
- **Type**: Classification / Regression (based on your competition)

## Contents of This Repository

- `kaggle__competition_cleaned.ipynb`: The final annotated Jupyter notebook used for training, validation, and prediction
- `submission.csv`: Prediction file generated for Kaggle submission
- `README.md`: Overview and documentation of this project

## Key Highlights

- Implemented multiple machine learning models including:
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Used advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques with `RandomizedSearchCV` for performance improvement
- Applied data preprocessing methods:
  - Null value imputation using grouped mode strategies
  - Label encoding and feature transformation
- Emphasis on clean, commented, and structured code to ensure readability and reproducibility

## Goals

- Participate meaningfully in a real-world competition setting
- Develop a deeper understanding of model tuning, validation, and evaluation
- Rank competitively on the public and private Kaggle leaderboard
